flatt skull threshold is unintresting trying to make one as function of the contences in hand
doing a flat multiplyer doesnt work bc then you get probabilites >1
using a principle of laplace smoothing such that (1 + x) / (# of card + x)
can switch to flower if i wanted to similate a nice player but i like this on principle

in my orginal smart player code i think that it was raising always when they got to bet or raise
will rerun simualtion if I have the time
