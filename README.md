# Skull-RL-CS-4100

Final project for CS 4100, creating an approximate Q learning agent to play the bluffing card game Skull (also called skull and roses)

Full report on project is the CS4100_final_McKennaQ.pdf file.

Non RL simulations (ones without a Q learning agent) contained in the non RL simaution folder. These simulations detailed in the background section of the report.

First Approximate Q learning agent, features only training on attempt, code contained in approx q learning skull attempt folder. Results detaied in the Q Learning Agent V1 - Attempt only subsection of the Experiment section of the report.

Second Approximate Q learning agent, features training on attempt and raise, code contained in approx q learning skull attempt raise folder. Results detaied in the Q Learning Agent V2 - Raise and Attempt subsection of the Experiment section of the report.

There are no differences the skull env or the static agents across folders, it was just easiest to contain each section of the report to its own folder. The differences come in the main files which run the game simulations for the agents and the q attempt agent files, chanes in pudocode outlined in report.
